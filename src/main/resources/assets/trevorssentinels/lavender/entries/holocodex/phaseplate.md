A form of **phase-reactive plating** used for equipment and facilities that often see the handling of [raw plasma](^trevorssentinels:plasma_cells).

---

Phaseplate bears a unique method of plasma shielding in its absorption of all phase particles that come into contact with it.
This causes the plates to **adopt the color** of the loose plasma, signaling that there may be danger present.

;;;;;

Personnel hoping to remove these residual phase particles may find it useful to synthesize a 'Palette Cleanser', a miraculous piece of
technology that safely disposes of all phase matter within its immediate area of use.
